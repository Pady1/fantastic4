## Introduction
Nowadays we are able to access national and international news quickly and easy, however statistics show that people who read news 
care more about their regions’ news. For example traffic, crime, emergency, new local policy, shops discount, etc. Abviously we cannot easily get the
local news all together comparing to national and international.

What is the journalistic problem? 
Bias, hard to come into new companies, if you're new it is hard to get in
No good resources, need the people who gererate the news, connection to gumtree for advertisement, excisting local groups on Facebook to get the users,
reward system you get
specific community as a target consumer

## Concept

journalistic criteria: you need 

outline the idea and the rationale behind it. Define the project aims and audience and
identify how your idea is different from / improves upon other current offerings.

## Team
Who is on your team, what are their responsibilities, and how will you work together? List all
the members and their course code. Identify:

- Who fills key roles, e.g. back end, front end, content, design;
- How will decisions be made;
- How will the team handle poor performance and resolve conflicts.

## Communications
The team will communicate via a private slack channel. In addition, we will have a weekly group meeting on DAY [FIXME]. Our files will be stored on GitHub

Where and when will your team meet and how will you all communicate?
Where will files be stored and shared? What are the file naming conventions?
Identify the social platform/s your team has adopted and explain the choice. How will it facilitate
communication and / or file sharing?
